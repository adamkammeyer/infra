# adamkammeyer/infra

This repo contains the code I use to build and maintain my personal infrastructure (on-prem and cloud) and self-hosted services.

Why are the commits so close together?  I discovered I had accidently commited some API keys so I took the opportunity to clean things up and rewrite history.

Currently I use Ansible and Terraform as my primary tools, but additional tools may slip in as needed.
